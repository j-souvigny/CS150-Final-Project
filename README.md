This program converts between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary number systems at the will of the user. 
  
Save the background.jpg , converter.html , converter.cgi , and localCGIServer.py in a host directory.

The program runs in a web browser via the localCGIServer program, similar to how the last class labs ran. Run the localCGIServer program and leave it running in the background. In a web browser, enter http://localhost:8080/converter.html . This will open the program in the web browser using the html formatting and allowing full interaction with the converter.cgi program.

The souvigny_numberSystemsConverter.py program offers the same functionality, but without the html and cgi implmentation.
